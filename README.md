# CodeDeck
A code editor made with Java, which is lightweight, incredibly simple, and has all the features you need!

## FAQ
**Q: Why make a new text editor when there are so many already out there?**
A: At my school, I hate all the editors installed on the machines. Furthermore, they blocked running an `exe` file that hadn't been approved by them. So I started making one myself. Using Java so I could compile into a `.jar` file, which aren't blocked. Yet.
